Election-Audit Summary
####
This script can be used for many future elections. First off. Many more counties can be added and accounted for in the counties_dict code. You could also add in what way voters lean politically by creating another column to see if people voted for candidates, they politically align with or if there was an upset in the election. We could create a political party dictionary that would compare the candidates political party and the voterâ€™s political party. They could also compare percentage of voters that voted for a candidate based on county using a nested if statement.
